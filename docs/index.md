jet1090 is a powerful tool for aviation enthusiasts :material-airplane-takeoff:, researchers :material-flask-outline:, and developers :material-source-pull:, which offers a **reliable, efficient, and flexible solution** for real-time ADS-B and Mode S data decoding and analysis.

jet1090 aims to be an essential open-source tool in the tangram suite for **tracking live flights** :material-airplane:, **analyzing real-time aviation traffic patterns** :material-map-marker-multiple-outline:, and **creating polished visualizations** :material-map-marker-path: with minimal code.

Built on the :material-language-rust: [**rs1090**](https://crates.io/crates/rs1090) library (which also provides :material-language-python: Python and WASM bindings), jet1090 offers:

- A **lightweight, standalone executable**, ideal for low-resource devices;
- **High-performance and comprehensive ADS-B and Mode S decoding**,  
  optimized for real-time processing through Rust’s speed and efficiency;
- **Input options**: compatible with Beast format, RTL-SDR dongles, and the SeRo gRPC API  
  (_contributions for more input formats is welcome_);
- **Output options**: files (JSON), a text user interface, REST, WebSocket, Redis pub/sub, etc.  
  (_contributions for more output formats is welcome_);
- Filtering capabilities common to all output options  
  include Downlink Format (DF), receiver identifier (custom), and ICAO24 aircraft transponder codes.

!!! warning

    These pages only document the **jet1090** tool.
    Follow the links for the documentation of the :material-language-rust: Rust library [**rs1090**](https://docs.rs/rs1090/) with :material-language-python: [Python bindings](https://pypi.org/project/rs1090/).

## Existing tools

- [**`dump1090`**](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) has played an important role in the popularization of crowdsourcing ADS-B data reception. Originally developed by [@antirez](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) on GitHub, the most up-to-date fork is maintained by [@mutability](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) for FlightAware. This fork supports many low-cost hardware devices, making ADS-B data reception accessible to a wider audience. Recent forks of `dump1090` now include features such as demodulation of messages at 2.4 MHz or 8 MHz. Another noteworthy development is [**`readsb`**](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb), a newer fork of `dump1090` that offers enhanced networking functionality and an aggregator backend.

- [**`pyModeS`**](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) is a Python library designed for decoding Mode S and ADS-B messages from aircraft. It provides a flexible and user-friendly interface for working with raw data, making it an excellent tool for enthusiasts and researchers in the field of aviation tracking. pyModeS decodes messages in Python (with some compiled Cython extensions as performance can be a bottleneck) provided some knowledge by the user. The author of pyModeS also offers an [online book](https://mode-s.org), to document the decoding of ADS-B and Mode S data.

Online services such as [FlightRadar24](https://flightradar24.com) provide an outstanding coverage of ADS-B data, but the data is proprietary. Displayed metadata information is of excellent quality, but trajectory information is filtered following an opaque process. [The OpenSky Network](https://www.opensky-network.org) offers unfiltered data with academic-friendly terms of use but decoded data is incomplete.

## Initial motivation

The development of the [**rs1090**](https://docs.rs/rs1090/) library and the jet1090 tool started because of limitations of the two previous tools:

- [**`dump1090`**](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) is a very efficient community-supported decoding tool whose main objective is trajectory visualization: decoding capabilities are incomplete, and output interfaces are limited. It is implemented in C.
- [**`pyModeS`**](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) offers a comprehensive decoding framework, easy to extend. It is based on a _“decode what you need”_ approach, so previous [knowledge about the data](https://mode-s.org) format is required. Initial decoding prototypes for real-time streams of data are very CPU and RAM consuming, and do not scale well. Multi-feed is not supported. It is implemented in Python.

## Design choices for jet1090

[**`rs1090`**](https://docs.rs/rs1090/) and [**`jet1090`**](/) are coded in :material-language-rust: Rust, for performance, code safety, and modularity.

- [**`rs1090`**](https://docs.rs/rs1090/) ports all the decoding knowledge of
  [**`pyModeS`**](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) in Rust. It is implemented following a _“decode it all”_ approach.
- [**`jet1090`**](/) is the executable program which connects data sources, merges data feeds, deduplicates messages, and serves decoded data in real-time.

By design, the language and standard low-level libraries (e.g., `trino` for the asynchronous programming, or `serde` for the serialization) makes it easy to access data in real-time **for those who don't know Rust and don't care about how things work**. All the data is decoded, serialized into a flattened JSON representation, and meta-information about the source of data is attached.

!!! example

    In the following example, the message `8d4400eb58c7d45c48e257428292` has been received by two different receivers within 200+ms. Timestamping information based on GNSS clocks has been attached, as well as signal strength. All the information present in the message is decoded and flattened in the JSON entry; latitude and longitude values are decoded based on the history of received [BDS 0,5 messages](https://docs.rs/rs1090/latest/rs1090/decode/bds/bds05/struct.AirbornePosition.html).
