# Serving real-time decoded data

## Output in the terminal

- The `--verbose` option dumps JSON entries to the terminal as messages are received.
- The `--interactive` option is similar to the `dump1090 --interactive` and provides a table view of the visible aircraft. For example the following snapshot can be obtained with a locally connected dongle with `jet1090 --interactive rtlsdr://`

Both options are incompatible and `--interactive` has the priority.

In the table view, aircraft can be sorted by:

| key |                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------- |
| `.` | number of messages (`count`), _default_ |
| `A` | altitude                                |
| `C` | callsign                                |
| `F` | first timestamp                         |
| `L` | last timestamp                          |
| `V` | vertical rate                           |
| `-` | ascending/descending order              |

## Output as a JSON file

The `-o` or `--output` option enables the dumping of decoded messages to a file in the JSON line format.

That format is easily accessible from several libraries across programming languages:

=== "Pandas (Python)"

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_json("output.jsonl", lines=True)
    ```

=== "Polars (Python)"

    ```python
    import polars as pl

    df = pl.read_ndjson("output.jsonl")
    ```

=== "Polars (Rust)"

    You will need the `lazy` and `ndjson` (new line delimited JSON) features:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    polars = { version = "0.34", features = ["lazy", "ndjson"] }
    ```

    ```rust
    use polars::prelude::*;

    let df = LazyFrame::scan_ndjson("output.jsonl", ScanArgsNdJson::default())?
        .collect()?;
    ```

=== "JavaScript"

    ```javascript
    data = fetch("output.jsonl")
      .then(response => response.text())
      .then(text => text.split("\n").filter(line => line.trim() !== "").map(JSON.parse));
    ```

=== "R"

    ```R
    library(ndjson)

    df <- ndjson::stream_in("output.jsonl")
    ```

## REST API

If a `--serve-port` option is set, a REST API is set on `0.0.0.0` on the port of your choice.

The following endpoint are provided:

- `/`: returns a list of all visible `icao24` identifiers
- `/all`: returns a list of all state vectors (the last valid field for each aircraft)
- `/track?icao24=xxx`: returns a list of all received messages for a given aircraft.

!!! warning

    By default, all the history remains accessible until the program exits but this behaviour can drain your RAM memory quickly if you see many aircraft. You can use the `--history-expire` parameter to limit the history to a number of minutes before the current time.

    You can also completely deactivate the storing of messages with the `--history-expire 0` option.

## WebSocket

(not yet supported)

## Redis pub/sub

If the `--redis-url` is set, all messages are sent to the Redis pub/sub instance.

The default topic is `jet1090` but it can be overriden with the `--redis-topic` option.

You may run a Redis server as a Docker or podman instance:

=== "Docker"

    ```sh
    docker run -d --rm --name redis -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
    ```

=== "podman"

    ```sh
    podman run -d --rm --name redis -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
    ```

You may check messages are incoming through the web interface on `http://localhost:8001` or with a redis CLI client, for instance:

```sh
$ uvx iredis
