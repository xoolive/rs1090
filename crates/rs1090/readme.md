# rs1090

rs1090 is a Rust library to decode Mode S, ADS-B and FLARM messages.

It takes its inspiration from the Python [pyModeS](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) library, and uses [deku](https://github.com/sharksforarms/deku) in order to decode binary data in a clean declarative way.

The project started as a fork of a very similar project called [adsb-deku](https://crates.io/crates/adsb_deku), but modules have been refactored to match [pyModeS](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) design, implementations extensively reviewed, simplified, corrected, and completed.

The directions ambitioned by rs1090 boil down to:

- improving the performance of Mode S decoding in Python;
- exporting trajectory data to cross-platform formats such as JSON or parquet;
- providing efficient multi-receiver Mode S decoding;
- serving real-time enriched trajectory data to external applications.

If you just want to decode ADS-B messages from your Raspberry and visualize the data on a map, you may want to stick to one of the dump0190 implementations.

The rs1090 library comes with a companion application [decode1090](https://crates.io/crates/decode1090) and a Python binding [rs1090](https://pypi.org/project/rs1090).

## Performance

Benchmarking performed on the decoding of a gate-to-gate [European flight](./data/long_flight.csv):

- [pyModeS](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) in full Python mode;
- [pyModeS](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS) with Cython compiled functions;
- `rs1090` with Python bindings on a single core (for a fair comparison);
- `rs1090` with Python bindings on many cores **(default)**;
- full Rust `rs1090` benchmark on many cores **(default)**.

The Python script for benchmarking is in [python/examples](python/examples/benchmark.py).  
The Rust benchmark is executed with `cargo bench`.  
Both scripts are run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10850H CPU @ 2.70GHz.

> [!NOTE]  
> The default out-of-the-box mode of `rs1090` is an execution distributed on all your cores. This benchmark was performed on a regular laptop. It can be much faster on supercomputers, but considering that most laptops now have at least 4 cores, this benchmark yields the speed-up you should get on your own computer.

## Installation

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```sh
cargo add rs1090
```

Or add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
rs1090 = "1.0.0"  # check for the latest version, we are not there yet
```

## Usage

```rust
use hexlit::hex;
use rs1090::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let bytes: [u8; 14] = hex!("8c4841753a9a153237aef0f275be");
    // ADS-B decoding
    if let Ok((_, msg)) = Message::from_bytes((&bytes, 0)) {
        // JSON output
        let json = serde_json::to_string(&msg).expect("JSON error");
        println!("{}", json);
    }
}
```

See more examples in the `crates/rs1090/examples` folder.

## Python bindings

You may install the bindings compiled for most Python versions with:

```sh
pip install rs1090
```

The library provides a single do-it-all function called `decode()`:

```pycon
>>> import rs1090
>>> rs1090.decode("8c4841753a9a153237aef0f275be")
{'df': '17',
 'icao24': '484175',
 'bds': '06',
 'NUCp': 7,
 'groundspeed': 17.0,
 'track': 92.8125,
 'parity': 'odd',
 'lat_cpr': 39195,
 'lon_cpr': 110320}
```

For large sets of messages in Python (e.g. what you can download through [pyopensky](https://github.com/open-aviation/pyopensky)):

```pycon
>>> import rs1090
>>> rs1090.decode(msg_list, ts_list)  # includes CPR to position decoding
...
>>> rs1090.decode(msg_list, ts_list, reference=(lat0, lon0))  # useful for surface messages
...
```

For FLARM messages (also as batches):

```pycon
>>> msg = "7bf2381040ccc7e2395ecaa28e033a655d47e1d91d0bf986e1b0"
>>> rs1090.flarm(msg, 1655279476, 43.61924, 5.11755)
{'timestamp': 1655279476,
 'reference_lat': 43.61924,
 'reference_lon': 5.11755,
 'icao24': '38f27b',
 'is_icao24': True,
 'actype': 'Glider',
 'latitude': 43.6812864,
 'longitude': 5.150585599999999,
 'geoaltitude': 970,
 'vertical_speed': 1.0,
 'groundspeed': 18.698261951315153,
 'track': 29.655457935479006,
 'no_track': False,
 'stealth': False,
 'gps': 129}
```
